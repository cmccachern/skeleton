# Contributing

## Pull Requests

Sumbit a pull request for any merges into master.  Before your request is merged,
the CI/CD pipeline must past building, linting, and testing.  This project uses
pylint to check enforce good Python style practices.

## Gitlab Issues

GitHub issues are used to track both bugs and subtasks.  Milestones are used to track overall progress.

## Adding Binary Files to Documentation

In general, it is preferable not to add binary files to the repository.  To add binary files to the documentation,
add them to Google Drive and create a shared link.  If this is a document that should not be accessible by the general public
(such as academic papers downloaded from a library database), then add specific people that are allowed to access this information.
